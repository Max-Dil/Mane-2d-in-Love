I welcome you to the Mane mini framework. It is based on creating 2d games
using objects. Mane draws objects by itself, checks clicks by itself and
has a local and global collision. There is also a module for synchronous timers
and json tables - require("mane.lib.json").

So far, it's raw, so I can't promise anything.

To initialize mane, you need to write:
require("mane")

The first code should be written in mane.load:
function mane.load()
-- game code
end

In mane, all objects are stored in groups.
Groups allow you to manage a large number of objects,
you can use them to create both scenes and a camera.

When initializing the game, mane will already create a group, it will
be in mane.display.game



Examples
Creating a group:
local group = mane.display.game:newGroup() -- instead of mane.display.game
can be any group

Creating a square:
local rect = group:newRect(200, 200, 50, 50) -- square in x: 200 , y: 200, width: 50, height: 50

Creating a circle:
local circle = group:newCircle(300, 300, 50) -- circle in x: 300, y: 300, radius: 50

Creating a Click listener:
rect:addClick(function(e)
    if e.phase == "began" then
        print("The square was pressed")
elseif e.phase == "moved" then
        print("The square is still pressed")
elseif e.phase == "ended"
        print("The square was released")
end
    return true -- so that everyone behind it doesn't feel the click
end)

Creating a timer:
local timer = mane.timer.new(1000, function() -- time: 1000 milliseconds(1 second), listener: listener
    print("A second has passed")
end)
